I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in my back <br>
I'm useless,but not for long<br>
The future is coming on<br>
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
I'm useless, but not for long<br>
The future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
<br>
Yeah... Ha Ha!<br>
Finally someone let me out of my cage<br>
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age<br>
Now I couldn't be there<br>
Now you shouldn't be scared<br>
I'm good at repairs<br>
And I'm under each snare<br>
Intangible<br>
Bet you didn't think so I command you to<br>
Panoramic view<br>
Look I'll make it all manageable<br>
Pick and choose<br>
Sit and lose<br>
All you different crews<br>
Chicks and dudes<br>
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?<br>
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube<br>
Like you lit the fuse<br>
You think it's fictional<br>
Mystical? Maybe<br>
Spiritual<br>
Hearable<br>
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy<br>
Lifeless<br>
To know the definition for what life is<br>
Priceless<br>
For you because I put you on the hype shit<br>
You like it?<br>
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token<br>
Psychic among those<br>
Possess you with one go<br>
<br>
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
I'm useless,but not for long<br>
The future is coming on<br>
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
I'm useless, but not for long<br>
The future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
<br>
The essence the basics<br>
Without it you make it<br>
Allow me to make this<br>
Child, like in nature<br>
Rhythm<br>
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy<br>
I'm in them<br>
Every sprouting tree<br>
Every child apiece<br>
Every cloud you see<br>
You see with your eyes<br>
I see destruction and demise<br>
Corruption in disguise<br>
&gt;From this fuckin' enterprise<br>
Now I'm sucking to your lies<br>
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides<br>
with me as a guide<br>
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye<br>
You perceive with your mind<br>
That's the inner<br>
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor<br>
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers<br>
Remember where the thought is<br>
I brought all this<br>
So you can survive when law is lawless<br>
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead<br>
No squealing, remember<br>
(that it's all in your head)<br>
<br>
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
I'm useless, but not for long<br>
The future is coming on<br>
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad<br>
I got sunshine, in a bag<br>
I'm useless, but not for long<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future is coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
It's coming on<br>
My future<br>
